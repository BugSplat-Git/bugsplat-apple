/**
 * Add an attribute and value to a dictionary of attributes that will potentially be included in a crash report.
 * If the attribute is an invalid XML entity name, or the attribute+value pair cannot be set,
 * the method will return NO, otherwise it will return YES.
 *
 * Attributes and values represent app supplied keys and values to associate with a crash report, should the app crash during this session.
 * Attributes and values will be bundled up in a BugSplatAttachment as NSData, with a filename of CrashContext.xml, MIME type of "application/xml" and encoding of "UTF-8".
 *
 * IMPORTANT: For iOS, only one BugSplatAttachment is currently supported.
 * If BugSplatDelegate's method `- (BugSplatAttachment *)attachmentForBugSplat:(BugSplat *)bugSplat` returns a non-nil BugSplatAttachment,
 * BugSplat will send that BugSplatAttachment, not the BugSplatAttachment that would otherwise be created due to adding attributes and values using this method.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * This method may be called multiple times, once per attribute+value pair.
 * This method may be called at any time during the app session prior to a crash.
 * Attributes are persisted to NSUserDefaults within a NSDictionary<NSString *, NSString *>, so attribute names must be unique.
 * If the attribute does not exist, it will be added to attributes dictionary.
 * If attribute already exists, the value will be replaced in the dictionary.
 * If attribute already exists, and the value is nil, the attribute will be removed from the dictionary.
 *
 * When this method is called, the following preprocessing occurs:
 * 1. attribute will be checked for XML entity name rules. If validation fails, method returns NO.
 *
 * 2. values will then be processed by an XML escaping routine which looks for escapable characters ",',&,<, and >
 * See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1091945/what-characters-do-i-need-to-escape-in-xml-documents
 * Any XML comment blocks or CDATA blocks found will disable XML escaping within the block.
 *
 * 3. After processing both attribute and value for XML escape characters, the attribute+value pair will be
 * persisted to NSUserDefaults within a NSDictionary<NSString *, NSString *>.
 *
 * 4. If the attribute or value cannot be set, the method will return NO, otherwise it will return YES.
 *
 * If a crash occurs, attributes and values will be bundled up in a BugSplatAttachment as NSData, with a filename of CrashContext.xml, MIME type of "application/xml"
 * and encoding of "UTF-8". The attachment will be included with the crash data (except as noted above regarding iOS BugSplatAttachment limitation).
 *
 * Attributes and their values are only valid for the lifetime of the app session and only used in a crash report if the crash occurs during that app session.
 * Any attributes set in the prior app session will be bundled up in a BugSplatAttachment as NSData, with a filename of CrashContext.xml,
 * MIME type of "application/xml" and encoding of "UTF-8". The attachment will be added to the crash report when it is processed during the next launch of the app.
 * If the app terminates normally, any attributes persisted during the prior `normal` app session will be erased during the next app launch.
